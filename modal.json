      "description": "Software engineers explore the world without paper and pens. In the situation that needs to introduce the self-experience, it absolutely has to be in a cool way. Then I got rid of the paperwork and tried to build a website displaying myself. This project takes the advantage of MacLinz's online course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV7S8BhIeBo). I learned many front-end skills built by HTML, CSS & JS and didn't take the help of Bootstrap intentionally while constructing my own site. Of course, I tried to change some codes to make this site connect to the database MongoDB and run properly in Node.js"

      "description": "Todo list is a classic project to practice the concept of RESTful, building routes, and operating the database. I spent much time learning the skills while coding. The main acquisition I got is how to save some time by using Node.js and modules provided in npm; using middlewares in Express set the routes by CRUD semantically. Last but not least, operating MongoDB by the methods in Mongoose spur on me to learn the concept of Promise in JS."
