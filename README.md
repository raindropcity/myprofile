# Ray's profile
Hi, I'm Ray. My specialized field is real estate investment & management, however, I found some passion in learning programming.  
I had tried using Javascript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Express to build a web application.  
Recently, I decided to learn the popular framework "React" by developing this project -- "learn_react".
## introduction
Please browse my profile at this site: https://rays-profile.onrender.com/myprofile <br>
Software engineers explore the world without paper and pens. In the situation that needs to introduce the self-experience, it absolutely has to be in a cool way. Then I got rid of the paperwork and tried to build a website displaying myself. This project takes the advantage of MacLinz's online course. I learned many frontend skills built by SCSS, HTML, CSS & JS and didn't take the help of Bootstrap intentionally while constructing my own site. Of course, I tried to change some codes to make this site connect to the database MongoDB and run properly in Node.js
